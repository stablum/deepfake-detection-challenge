\section{Motivation}

If there is something that I miss in my education it's probably
machine learning applied on 3D rasters and temporal data.
The deepfake challenge seems to be the perfect opportunity
to dive deep in methods that I haven't tried before.
Specifically, analysis of video data may employ techniques from both domains
as videos can be interpreted as 3D grids, as well as a sequence of datapoints that
is subject to causal evolution. The first interpretation would suggest using
convolutional neural network with a 3D kernel; the latter suggests recurrent neural networks
and LSTMs.
